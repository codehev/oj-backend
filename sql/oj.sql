Pascal 使用 `integer` 会爆掉哦！\n2. 有负数哦！\n3. C/C++ 的 main 函数必须是 `int` 类型，而且 C 最后要 `return 0`。这不仅对洛谷其他题目有效，而且也是 NOIP/CSP/NOI 比赛的要求！\n\n好吧，同志们，我们就从这一题开始，向着大牛的路进发。\n\n> 任何一个伟大的思想，都有一个微不足道的开始。\n\n## 输入格式\n\n两个以空格分开的整数。\n\n## 输出格式\n\n一个整数。\n\n## 样例 #1\n\n### 样例输入 #1\n\n```\n20 30\n```\n\n### 样例输出 #1\n\n```\n50\n```\n\n## 提示\n\n**本题各种语言的程序范例：**\n\nC\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n    int a,b;\n    scanf(\"%d%d\",&a,&b);\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", a+b);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n----------------\n\nC++\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdio>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main()\n{\n    int a,b;\n    cin >> a >> b;\n    cout << a+b << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n----------------\n\nPascal\n\n```cpp\nvar a, b: longint;\nbegin\n    readln(a,b);\n    writeln(a+b);\nend.\n```\n\n-----------------\n\nPython2\n\n```cpp\ns = raw_input().split()\nprint int(s[0]) + int(s[1])\n```\n\n-----------------\n\nPython3\n\n```cpp\ns = input().split()\nprint(int(s[0]) + int(s[1]))\n```\n\n-----------------\n\nJava\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {\n        Scanner cin=new Scanner(System.in);\n        int a = cin.nextInt(), b = cin.nextInt();\n        System.out.println(a+b);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n-----------------\n\nJavaScript （Node.js）\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require(\'fs\')\nconst data = fs.readFileSync(\'/dev/stdin\')\nconst result = data.toString(\'ascii\').trim().split(\' \').map(x => parseInt(x)).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)\nconsole.log(result)\nprocess.exit() // 请注意必须在出口点处加入此行\n```\n\n-----------------\n\nRuby\n\n```ruby\na, b = gets.split.map(&:to_i)\nprint a+b\n```\n\n-----------------\n\nPHP\n\n```php\n<?php\n$input = trim(file_get_contents(\"php://stdin\"));\nlist($a, $b) = explode(\' \', $input);\necho $a + $b;\n```\n\n-----------------\n\nRust\n\n```rust\nuse std::io;\n\nfn main(){\n    let mut input=String::new();\n    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();\n    let mut s=input.trim().split(\' \');\n\n    let a:i32=s.next().unwrap()\n               .parse().unwrap();\n    let b:i32=s.next().unwrap()\n               .parse().unwrap();\n    println!(\"{}\",a+b);\n}\n```\n\n-----------------\n\nGo\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    var a, b int\n    fmt.Scanf(\"%d%d\", &a, &b)\n    fmt.Println(a+b)\n}\n```\n\n-----------------\n\nC# Mono\n\n```cs\nusing System;\n\npublic class APlusB{\n    private static void Main(){\n        string[] input = Console.ReadLine().Split(\' \');\n        Console.WriteLine(int.Parse(input[0]) + int.Parse(input[1]));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n------------------\n\nVisual Basic Mono\n\n```vb\nImports System\n\nModule APlusB\n    Sub Main()\n        Dim ins As String() = Console.ReadLine().Split(New Char(){\" \"c})\n        Console.WriteLine(Int(ins(0))+Int(ins(1)))\n    End Sub\nEnd Module\n```\n\n------------------\n\nKotlin\n\n```kotlin\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n    val (a, b) = readLine()!!.split(\' \').map(String::toInt)\n    println(a + b)\n}\n```\n\n------------------\n\nHaskell\n\n```haskell\nmain = do\n    [a, b] <- (map read . words) `fmap` getLine\n    print (a+b)\n```\n\n------------------\n\nLua\n\n```lua\na = io.read(\'*n\')\nb = io.read(\'*n\')\nprint(a + b)\n```\n\n------------------\n\nOCaml\n\n```ocaml\nScanf.scanf \"%i %i\\n\" (fun a b -> print_int (a + b))\n```\n\n------------------\n\nJulia\n\n```julia\nnums = map(x -> parse(Int, x), split(readline(), \" \"))\nprintln(nums[1] + nums[2])\n```\n\n------------------\n\nScala\n\n```scala\nobject Main extends App {\n    println(scala.io.StdIn.readLine().split(\" \").map(_.toInt).sum)\n}\n```\n\n------------------\n\nPerl\n\n```perl\nmy $in = <STDIN>;\nchomp $in;\n$in = [split /[\\s,]+/, $in];\nmy $c = $in->[0] + $in->[1];\nprint \"$c\\n\";\n```', '[\"模拟\"]', 'public class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int var1 = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);\n        int var2 = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);\n        System.out.println(var1 + var2);\n    }\n}', 0, 0, '[{\"input\":\"20 30\",\"output\":\"50\"},{\"input\":\"12 13\",\"output\":\"25\"},{\"input\":\"6 9\",\"output\":\"15\"}]', '{\"timeLimit\":10,\"memoryLimit\":10,\"stackLimit\":10}', 0, 0, 2, '2023-11-15 17:00:11', '2024-01-06 09:55:31', 0);
